            <h1>Story page</h1>
            <p>This may turn out to be my blogpage...but right now it is just what it is</p>
            <p>This project will be a small win app to hold your frame... You get points for being you,
                for staying your ground. So pick a topic, like saying no, and every time you stay 
                your ground you say no. So I need a dropdown or a tabs to choose from and then get 
                suggestions and info and for every time I do this I will fill up my frame...
                <ul>
                    <li>Saying no</li>
                    <li>Accepting that it is okey feel bad</li>
                    <li>Breath before talking</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
